# ItemPurchaseFrequency

Summary: To create a console app that would take in a text file of strings and count the frequency at which each string appears on the list and then be able to output the results in various formats based on user selections.

What I did well: I did a good job intaking the file contents to a dictionary and validating user input.

What I could enhance: Better usage of try/catch to grab specifics rather than just any possible error thrown.

Most challenging code: Sucessfully implenting try/catches in the code was actually the most difficult part for me because I struggled with understanding some of the concepts behring try/catch in c++. I overcame this difficulty by reaching out to a friend who was able to review my code and better explain try/catch to me so I could more successfully utilize it.

Transferable skills: From this project specifically I think that reading from/writing to files will probably be the most tranferable skill as I continue to work on other projects of vaious types and programming languages.

Program maintainable: To help with the adaptability and maintainability of this program I really did my best to break out as much of the functionality as I could into individual functions within the object to have the different processes be very independent and able to change modify 1 without having to change all.
